## Autoregressive process
is a regression of a varialbe against itself.  In a time series, this means that the present value is linearly dependent on its past values.  

The autoregressive process is denoted as AR(p), where p is the order. the general expression of an AR(p) model is
y_t = C + \theta_1 * y_t-1 * \theta_2 * y_t-2 + ...  + white_noise

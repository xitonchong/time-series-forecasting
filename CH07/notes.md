An autoregressive integrated average (ARIMA) processes is the combination of the AR(p) and MA(q) processes, but in terms of the differenced seris. 

It is denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q), where p is the order of the AR(p) processes, d is the order of integration, and q is the order of MA(q) process.  

Integration is the reverse of differencing, and the order of intergration d is equal to the number of times the series has been differenced to be rendered stationary. 

the general equation of the ARIMA(p,d,q) process is
